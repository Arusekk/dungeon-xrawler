INSTALATION NOTES
=================

You need g++ (= gcc-c++), make and a terminal while compiling source code. Just enter the
main folder and type `./configure' (this checks if you have all the requirements).
Then if you fulfilled our requirements just type `make'. Since now, you can run it directly (`./dungeon-xrawler').

NOTE: If you want your language translation, type `make translate'. This command is not
perfect as it for granted that you have `lokalize' tool installed.

For Windows you can just download the installer [WorkInProgress]
