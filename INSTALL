INSTALATION NOTES
=================

You need g++ (= gcc-c++), make and a terminal while compiling source code. Just enter the
build folder and type `make'. Then you can run it directly (`./dungeon-xrawler').

NOTE: If you want your language translation, type `make translate'. This command is not
perfect as it has problems with two-block language names (like pt_BR) and (if your translation
is not already written) takes for granted that you have `lokalize' tool installed.

For Windows you can just download the installer [WorkInProgress]
